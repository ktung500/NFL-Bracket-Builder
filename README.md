# NFL-Bracket-Builder
# A dynamic website I built from scratch which helps the user easily visualize an NFL playoff bracket. 
# The website uses php session variables to communicate data between pages. Since this is a dynamic website with php files, it cannot be hosted on github pages. 
# Personally I use XAMPP to support PHP and open my website locally.
